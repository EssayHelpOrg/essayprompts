 <h1> What is a prompt and prompts?</h1>
<p>In essay writing, a prompt is a structured inquiry asking the writer to provide some preliminary information about a topic. The writer is required to fill in all the blanks and commit them to paper.</p>
<p>Most of us tend to misuse the word prompt since it is used to describe a direct inquiry. However, a prompt is not an inquiry. It is an inquiry with a specific, straight forward inquiry to be answered. It is always advisable to make your essay prompt relevant and informative.</p>
<h2> What can you do when your prompt is not straight forward?</h2>
<p>Here are some hints that you can follow during the writing process to ease the pressure of writing your essay prompt:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Read some materials to better understand what prompts are asking for. It is usually recommended to look through books to review the topic.</li>
	<li>Watch some videos that are related to the topic <a href="https://essaywritersllc.com/buy-essay">https://essaywritersllc.com/buy-essay</a>. The videos can play some role of attracting the reader to your content.</li>
	<li>Make an outline during the writing process. It will help you break down the paper into manageable parts.</li>
	<li>Seek clarifications from the tutor for any wordings that you do not understand.</li>
	<li>The final document should be polished by editing it thoroughly to capture all the nuances of your points.</li>
</ul>
<h3> What are the things a good article should have?</h3>
<p>Regardless of your course, the basic piece that you are taught in class is an article. However, many essays are written differently to cater to different essays. Some of these factors need to be considered:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Cover page – while the paper usually has the subject, one should ask themselves whether the paper needs a cover page. This should cover the name of the student, the course instructor, the institution's name, and the date.</li>
	<li>Main body paragraph – which should be approximately one hundred words. This should contain all the main points that the instructor wants you to explore through the essay.</li>
	<li>Answer to the prompt – it is essential to give a step-by-step direction to the prompts.</li>
	<li>List of recommended references – this will help you stay organized when using the cited material.</li>
	<li>Edit your work – it is always wise to proofread the article and then submit it.</li>
	<li>Revisit the topic periodically – it can be risky to start the essay when you are not sure of its theme. It is always best to revisit the original problem if you feel like you can improve on the background.</li>
	<li>Write a draft after the writing process – it can be best to revise your essay after you are done with it to ensure that you have tackled every point. Just make sure to restate what you have defined when proofreading your work.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can never beat the feeling of making an informed choice with your next step. Writing is a simple process that anyone can follow.</p>
